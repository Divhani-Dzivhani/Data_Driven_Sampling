# DataScopeR:  R Project on Statistical Sampling

 Project that showcases statistical sampling methods through real-world educational examples in R.

 It includes well-documented R scripts that demonstrate key statistical concepts such as:

- Judgment vs Simple Random Sampling
- Systematic vs Random Path Sampling
- Proportional Stratified Sampling

---

##  Techniques Demonstrated

### 1. sampling_comparison.R
- Compares judgment and random sampling using a dataset of rectangle areas
- Visualizes mean variation using histograms and boxplots

### 2. map_sampling_visual.R
- Uses ABQ path data to show systematic vs SRS on a coordinate map
- Adds visual interpretation to sample selection strategies

### 3. stratified_sampling.R
- Explores gender-based proportional sampling
- Compares mean height estimates across sampling methods

##  Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Sampling theory and bias reduction
- Exploratory data analysis using `R`
- Creating informative visualizations with `hist()`, `boxplot()`, and `plot()`
- Writing clean, reproducible R code

##  How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Place all relevant `.csv` files into the `/data` folder
3. Open and run scripts from the `/src` folder using RStudio
